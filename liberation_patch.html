	3DO has updated Meridian 59 with a big patch today. Here is a list of things that I have noticed 
	or heard about that have been changed. Thanks to Kheyrian and Cain Keja for some of the info:
	
	<ul>
		<li> now in raza the platform that normally lowers and has shillings on it has magic mushies, elders, and herbs plus money, so it opens up the door on what spells you can work there, plus you get entroots from kills still.
		<li> Free action lasts about a 1/4 of its previous duration.
		<li> soth's are bugged, no stat bonuses right now
		<li> the assassins game is bugged also, you get killed for real in it currently.
		<li>the touch spells will imp on the cast occasionally, but mainly on the touch, 
		though still on the kill occasionally. (I maxed icy fingers in a total of about 3 1/2 - 4 hours)
		<li>create weapon does create short swords and maces, but long swords at high %.
		<li>you can log off in the mausoleum in raza, without being moved
		<li> the short sleeved jerkins that you get on the island are normally impervious to attack 
		when worn under armor, well not any more.
		
		<li> also enchant weapon now also requires orc teeth to cast along with the usual components
		
		<li> the touch spells that are now enchantments to be used over and over imp on the touch not 
		the cast or the kill
		
		<li> Armor of Gort lasts much longer and can be casted on other players.
		<li> Super Strength takes 5 elderberries to cast now.
		<li> Enchanted items now display the name of the enchanter on them.
		<li> When casting rescue with a shal'ille robe on you can rescue to multiple towns. 
		<li> You can also cast rescue on other players now. Apparentely they have to say the 
				name of the location they want to go. A list of qualifying destinations will 
				appear once the caster casts rescue on the player. For instance, you can 
				rescue another character to Brax if you want. <i><font color=HotPink>
The world shimmers and secret paths are revealed, leading to The Aerie Guest House, Decaying City of Brax, The Streets of Tos, Marion, South Barloque, Cor Noth, and East Jasper.
</font></i>
		<li> You can't drop created maces now.
		<li> Truce takes an emerald and Yrxl Sap to cast.
		<li> You can cast personal enchantments, like Super Strength on other characters now.
		<li> There are text changes when fighting with weapons/spells. Parry actually parries, dodge actually dodges, 
				and the different gauges of slashing: maiming, grazing, cleansing, slashing.
		<li> Guages of slashing do different amounts of damage. For instance grazing someone 
				doesnt do nearly as much as maiming.
		<li> looks like you really hit more with high aim now
		<li>  Create mace is now create weapon but i created a mace even at 99
		<li>  Create food now creates different food
		<li>  Dazzle last a little less longer 
		<li> Touch spells are now personal enchantments. So when casted, your hands have the 
				touch spell attached to them for a period of time so it makes your punch a more 
				deadly weapon. 
		<li> You cannot logoff in the Raza maze pit (where the shadow mummy is). You'll reappear 
				near the door when you log back on.
		<li> Holy Weapon costs 5 emeralds to cast.
	</ul><p>
