Colhorr says, "I've seen Tova and Jonas conversing quietly in the corner a few times, never could hear what they were saying though, and soon as I'd walk in they'd break apart."<p>

Colhorr says, "I find it strange that you can never seem to find Jonas when you want to.  He seems like the slippery type that could make a quick getaway."<p>
