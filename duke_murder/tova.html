Tova tells you, "I don't know anything about a weapon, but I do know that the feast hall was locked, no way in or out.  So whoever killed him must have had some way of teleporting out of there.  The only people I know of with magic like that are the necromancers."<p>

Tova tells you, "People say that the intense feelings of dislike the Duke had for the poor Princess might have played a role in that dark night.  I doubt that this is the case.  While such feelings can drive one to rash actions, I don't think the young Princess struck out at him."<p>

Tova says, "I hear Akardius has taken well to his uncle's duties. How convenient."<p>

Tova says, "Ran er'Hoth said the other day that the murder was done with a spoon.  Didn't Jonas say that he defended himself with a spoon one time when he was attacked in an inn?"<p>

Tova says, "I overheard a conversation where one person told another that they heard Miriana running through the woods screaming something about Faren and wanting her weapon back.  What could that mean?"<p>

Tova tells you, "There have been whispers about the dark wizard Maleval...  I think people are just frightened of him because he's so mysterious."<p>

Tova tells you, "A mage once told me that the Princess secretly supports Miriana because she knows how to tap the raw power of magic.  Could they have plotted against the Duke together?"<p>

Tova tells you, "I find it strange that you can never seem to find Jonas when you want to.  He seems like the slippery type that could make a quick getaway."<p>

Tova tells you, "Well, I'm sure I don't know anything about that.  I was visiting my mother; she's not well you know.  But if you think about it, it seems like the necromancers have been awfully quiet lately, maybe too quiet."<p>

Tova says, "I bet the Duke just killed himself, I mean wouldn't you if you had to listen to enough of Parrin's songs?"<p>

Tova says, "They say that Duke Akardius was an accomplished swordsman. Not that he'd have to be all that tough to get the jump on his uncle.  I mean after all he was a bit, um... big boned."<p>
