Frisconar tells you, "Isn't it strange that the Duke was murdered so violently, but no one saw or heard anything?  Perhaps there was some strange magic at work that night."<p>

Frisconar tells you, "I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but a friend of mine works as a guard for the Duke and he says that there is a big cover up going on.  Seems the Duke wasn't murdered at all!  He killed himself trying to take off an Amulet of the Three!"<p>

Frisconar tells you, " Well, I heard that one of the innkeepers was delivering some ale to the Duke's castle, to get ready for the big banquet.  Apparently there was a curious woman hanging around the delivery carts when they were going in.  He said she had very pale skin and was wearing a strange amulet."<p>

Frisconar says, "Only the blind would not notice how the Princess was conspicuously absent the night of the murder.  Can we trust her stories?"<p>

Frisconar says, "Well, I'm sure I don't know anything about that.  I was visiting my mother; she's not well you know.  But if you think about it, it seems like the necromancers have been awfully quiet lately, maybe too quiet."<p>

Frisconar says, "You know I wouldn't put it past that simpering fop, Parrin, he's had his eyes on Duke Kalior for a long time now."<p>

Frisconar says, "You know some say that the Duke was actually poisoned, now Joguer he is an expert in those matters dealing with fatal substances."<p>

Frisonar says, "Maleval certainly seems to like young Akardius.  He seems almost protective.  I suppose it's only natural after what happened to Kalior."<p>
