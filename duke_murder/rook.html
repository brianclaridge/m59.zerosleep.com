Rook says, "This Akardius makes the hairs on the back of my neck rise. Someone ought to watch him."<p>

Rook says, "I'd be paying close attention to Parrin's song's if I were you, if he starts singing about murder it might well be a confession."<p>

Rook says, "It wouldn't be the first death under suspicious causes Quintor was linked too."<p>

Rook says, "There was a sickly green slime found on the murder weapon, smelled so bad one of the guards almost keeled over from the stench."<p>

Rook says, "Tova certainly does have the strength to drive a blade deep into a body."<p>

Rook says, "I've heard mutterings around Barloque about sending troops into the sewers to 'clean them out', but it sounds like a witch hunt to me.  Everyone knows Roq retired years ago."<p>
