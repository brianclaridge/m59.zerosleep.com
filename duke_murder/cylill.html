Cylill tells you, "I've got a friend who tends the castle gardens and while he was trimming the hedges under the Duke's window he heard Maleval say, "Tread carefully Kalior.  You would not want to try my patience."  He says he thinks they were arguing earlier about a planned offensive against Brax."<p>
