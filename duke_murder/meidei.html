Meidei says, "Someone told me that they saw Roq the day after the Duke's murder carrying only one blade.  Doesn't he usually have two?"<p>

Meidei says, "Well, travellers have told me that they see Miriana dancing in the woods with a knife.  Where did she get a weapon?"<p>

Meidei says, "They say that the Duke was killed by magic, the school of Faren has many offensive spells, and who knows them better than the Faren Priestess."<p>

Meidei says, "You know I see Madelia down in the sewers every once in awhile, can't figure why she would be down there unless she was visiting someone."<p>

Meidei says, "Tova does have quite a mean streak in him, you wouldn't know it from his horrendous jokes but he does."<p>

Meidei says, "Parrin seems fairly harmless to me, that is if he doesn't sing."<p>
