Paddock tells you, "There is more to Duke Akardius then meets the eye;  ever wonder where he's been all these years?  The Island, studying at the Temple of Riija, that's where!  I tell you, anyone who has spent that much time with the God of Trickery isn't to be trusted."<p>

Paddock tells you, "I recently went to the woods to find some herbs, and I overheard an adventurer talking to Miriana.  When he mentioned the Duke, she got very angry and refused to teach him the spells he requested."<p>

Paddock tells you, "Bah!  This whole thing is ridiculous.  The fact is the Duke just couldn't wait to start the feast and Akardius is too embarassed to admit that his uncle ate himself to death."<p>

Paddock tells you, "My cousin's wife's brother is certain that Maleval was at the Qor temple the night of the Duke's murder... um... I mean, not that she would ever go there.  Nobody in my family follows Qor.  Certainly not!"<p>

Paddock says, "Well, I certainly think it is strange that the Meridian Council had been meeting quite frequently at night the week before the poor Duke's bloody demise."<p>

Paddock says, "I overheard a guard say that he went with a small band of guards into the forest looking for Miriana. He said that when they found her, they tried to give her a message from the Duke, but that she grew angry and left.  Did she hate the Duke?"<p>

Paddock says, "Huh, what did Tova do? Tell him bad jokes till he croaked."<p>
