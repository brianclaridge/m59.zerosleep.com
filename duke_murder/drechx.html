Drechx says, "This Akardius has his head on straight. If the people will it, my vote is his."<p>

Drechx says, "Some people say that it must have been the lich queen who killed the Duke, but we all know that she hasn't left Brax in millennia."<p>

Drechx says, "Duke Kalior's been killed?  Huh, who did it?"<p>

Drechx says, "People say that the intense feelings of dislike the Duke had for the poor Princess might have played a role in that dark night.  I doubt that this is the case.  While such feelings can drive one to rash actions, I don't think the young Princess struck out at him."<p>
