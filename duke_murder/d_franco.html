D'Franco says, "I thought I heard that Jonas was blaming Rook for the murder.  Isn't it funny that he would try to get Rook in trouble, especially when you consider their history together?"<p>

D'Franco says, "I heard from a traveling merchant that there were all sorts of flashing lights and strange noises coming from the mountains over Brax on the night the Duke died."<p>

D'Franco says, "I heard that Duke Kalior and Yevitan went to school together."<p>

D'Franco says, "Tova was still pretty bitter about Paddock getting Familiars in Tos, cause he wanted that space as well."<p>
