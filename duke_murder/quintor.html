Quintor tells you, "I've heard that one of the Duke's guards saw someone who looked exactly like the Duke walking out of the castle after the Duke had died.  He ran up to investigate, but whoever it was just disappeared, leaving only a puddle of slimy goo."<p>

Quintor tells you, "Someone told me they saw Roq make a large deposit in Obert's vault shortly after the murder.  It was wrapped in cloth, but was apparently very heavy and made a clanking sound."<p>

Quintor tells you, "I thought I heard a priestess say that there were strange magical forces at work that night.  I wonder if the Princess knows anything about that?"<p>

Quintor tells you, "My cousin's wife's brother is certain that Maleval was at the Qor temple the night of the Duke's murder... um... I mean, not that she would ever go there.  Nobody in my family follows Qor.  Certainly not!"<p>

Quintor says, "You know I think I remembering seeing Yevitan lurking in the sewers one day a few weeks back, wonder what he was doing down there."<p>

Quintor says, "Logically speaking, it seems the easiest way to kill someone would be to hire an assassin.  That shifts blame away from you.  But then I've never planned a murder, so how would I know?"<p>

Quintor tells you, "I have it from a very authoritative source that Kalior was beaten to death, but I don't believe it for a second. I'm certain Maleval did it and a beating just isn't his style."<p>
