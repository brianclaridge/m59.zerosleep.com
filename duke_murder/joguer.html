Joguer tells you, "A friend says he saw a shadowy figure moving quickly through the Twisted Woods on the night of the murder.  He called out a greeting and it looked up at him with glowing red eyes, then disappeared."<p>

Joguer tells you, "I heard that Akardius took the Duke's body to a healer, even though he was dead.  I guess he was really desperate to save him."<p>

Joguer tells you, "Well, travellers have told me that they see Miriana dancing in the woods with a knife.  Where did she get a weapon?"<p>

Joguer tells you, "Well, don't tell Duke Akardius I said this, but its hard to think of anyone else who had access to the feast hall, now isn't it?"<p>

Joguer says, "Thou should understand that the death of the Duke is a bane. His nephew, even more incompetent than Kalior has taken the reigns of power."<p>

Joguer says, "From what I've heard the Duke wasn't killed with a weapon or by magic.  It was poison.  Isn't poison the way the royals have always killed members of their own family?"<p>

Joguer tells you, "A friend of a friend told me that Miriana was in the forest one day, and for no reason, she cried out, 'I did it, my lady. He is dead.' I wonder if she meant the Duke?"<p>
