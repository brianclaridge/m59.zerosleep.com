Meridian 59 has seen itself through an original release and four updates. Its success is due to the time and effort that you and customers like you have invested in the game. 3DO wishes to maintain a high level of satisfaction on your part and, through the past releases, has tried to bring you a more fulfilling and enjoyable experience. To date a number of customer-reported bugs and problems have been logged, and we wish to make every effort to fix them. We have created a patch that covers many issues reported to us, and will continue to work on those that have been and will be reported.<p>

In this patch:<p>

<font color="#CCFFCC"><b>1. A number of text bugs have been addressed.</b></font><p>

<font color="#CCFFCC"><b>2. We have made some fixes to the Necromancer/ Hunter Scenario</b></font><br>
<ul>
     <li> When the queen dies, the pendants will respawn

     <li> Necromancers who try to remove their Amulet of the Three in the arena stands will die

     <li> Necromancers who try to remove their Amulet of the Three in the arena will not lose the Amulet of the Three and will be sent to the stands (see above entry)

     <li> Necromancers who lose their Amulet of the Three are removed from the guild

     <li> We are still working on fixing players whose statistics have been altered by the Sword of the Hunt
</ul><p>

<font color="#CCFFCC"><b>3. Lag-related ASCII characters. It has been found that there are many ASCII characters that can be used to lag players and the game. Those characters have been removed from the game. On the downside, this means that there will be limited information that can be indicated on a banner or in a player bio.</b></font><p>

<font color="#CCFFCC"><b>4. The spell Shatterlock has been fixed.</b></font><p>

<font color="#CCFFCC"><b>5. Murderer (PK) fixes have been made:</b></font><br>
<ul>
	<li>Logging off for PKers in an unsafe area incurs a penalty based on the number of players killed and the number of times that that PKer has logged off unsafely

     <li> PKers are treated as Guilded in towns and can kill and be killed by other Guilded players

     <li> Shrunken heads will not track a suicided PKer
</ul><p>

<font color="#CCFFCC"><b>6. Characters under 30 Hit Points:</b></font><br>
<ul>
     <li> Will take no damage from Firewall, Lightning wall, or Poison Fog
     <li> Operating a gnarled staff drains charges so that it can not be used to spam people
</ul><p>

<font color="#CCFFCC"><b>7. The spells Enfeeble and Dement: The duration of effect has been shortened.</b></font><p>

<font color="#CCFFCC"><b>8. Casting holy touch on positive karma players will not remove you from your faction.</b></font><p>

We recognize that two groups of bugs warrant a lot of attention. These involve bugs related to the statistic progression engine, and bugs related to the quest engine. Bugs related to these two groups take a lot of attention and time to fix, and we are devoted to them. We hope that we can have these addressed either before or in the Dark Auspices release currently slated for November.<p>

Thank you for your feedback and your most welcome patronage,<p>
