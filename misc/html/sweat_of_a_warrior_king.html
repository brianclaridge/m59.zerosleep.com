The item "Sweat of a Warrior King" is used to get sporeburst from Maleval.. he will ask you upon entering the same room as him with a tell......Maleval tells you, "lord (your_name), it is indeed a pleasure to see you.  I have watched your progress in the arcane studies with great interest;  rarely have I encountered one so worthy of my tutelage.  You may know of my research in the magical arts.  Well, I have at last crafted an entirely new spell, grafted together from the energy fields of what the religious rabble would call Faren and Qor.  I will teach you my new incantation, if you but perform one small task for me:  bring me the sweat of the warrior king, that I may research its mystical properties.<p>

<font color="#ccccff">Other Use:</font> Sweat of the Warrior king is also used to dedicate the shrine to kraanan and make Kraanan spells stronger for as long as the Shrine stays dedicated to Kraanan.<p>

<font color="#ccccff">Location:</font> This reagent is located in a secret room on the east wall of the King Lupogg chamber.... After you kill the King, the water will rise. Behind the east wall waterfall, an opening will be created, about halfway during the ascent of the platform... run through the passage, and the sweat and a random item will pop in there
