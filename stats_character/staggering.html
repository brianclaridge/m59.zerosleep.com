<b>Arutha/Lyam (109)</b><br>

I never staggered actually but I did one little experiment with my second char "Lyam" and it worked :-)<p>

How much You can advance / learn in spells/skills depends on how many schools (that makes how many spells) You have.....So, just do not buy all spells from certain level when we all know that now only 3spells total from each level counts.....try it.....for example I didnt buy enchant weapon, resist poison, killing fields, anti magic aura, unholy weapon, nodeburst, death link etc....etc....and trust me it HELPED me<p>

I am WC master, Kraanan master, Qor master, Faren master and Riija lev3 - can go even more furhter with ao3 and 2intel boons and I have 27intel - NEVER did any kind of staggering, except I got lev2 Faren and then I did Riija..... I did schools in this order.....WC lev4, Qor mastered, Kraanan mastered, Faren lev2, Riija lev3, Faren mastered.....I can also get spore burst from Maleval and lev6 Faren from  Tendrath<p>

Dont buy all spells, try it ;-)<p>

This way will save you alot of time and money.  Get Weapon Craft to level 4. Next do Kraanan until level 3. Then Qor or Shal'ille to level 3.  After Qor or Shal'ille do Rijja until level 3. Then Faren to level 3. Master Qor, Faren, Riija, and Kraanan in that order.  You MUST master Kraanan last.<p>
