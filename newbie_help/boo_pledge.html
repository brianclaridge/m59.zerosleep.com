Chili Peppers,<p>

At one time or another you have expressed an interest in joining Blades of the Oracle, aka BOO, aka the Pantless  Wonders.  Most people who express an interest are under heavy medication, so we'll understand if you've since sobered up, joined another guild, or become the lead singer in an air guitar band.<p>

BOO is not for everyone; the send group would be ridiculous.  Also, we have a finite number of oreos.<p>

<b>The rules for the guild used to be:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    1) no pants!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    2) Join and support the Duke when able.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    3) t mathis LOL as often as possible<p>

After careful consideration, we have altered #1 (naked or purple pants is acceptable), dropped #2, and decided that #3 is really the whole reason the guild exists anyway.<p>

<b>How you get to be BOO:</b>

We have this program called the "Pledge" program, where you shine all our wood surfaces and leave them smelling lemony.  Also, you spend a week or so in a send group with myself and the other BOO Council members, and we scope you out while you scope us out.   At the end of the week, if you want to apply, we'll take a vote.  Unanimous,  and you're in.<p>

We are starting a new pledge group immediately.  If you're interested, tell me or gmail me =)
