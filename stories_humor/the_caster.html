<b>"The Caster" by Mathis Beornstanas -- inspired by William the Just</b>

to the tune of
"The Gambler" by Kenny Rogers

On a calm Meridian evening, on a walk back from the island
I met an ancient caster, I could hear his leg bones creak
He didn't bat an eye at cave orcs or the wailing in darkness
At the Spring we drank our health back, the mage began to speak

He said, son I've made a life out of choosing the right mushrooms 
And knowing who my foes are, and the threats they pose to me 
Your face tells me your story, you don't yet know ways of magic 
I can teach you of the secrets, for just two of your inkies.

So I handed him the mushies, and he ate them in an instant,
Even water-satisfied, he weren't too full to eat
And then in the sloshing darkness, with orc cries in the distance 
He said these sagely words to me, his eyes now burning heat.

Chorus:
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to bolt 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to log
You never count your money, when you're sittin' at the fountain
There'll be time for bank runs, when the casting's done.

Every caster knows that mana is the key to his survival
You can't hurt a giant rat if your supply is all deplete
And you never roam the lands without reagents for some damage
Or they'll find your robe a-lying there at your corpse's feet.

And when he finished speakin', he floated 'round the spring's exterior
The room collapsed around me like a sudden plate corset 
And I heard his heavy breathing like a high percentage wind spell 
To this day I'd know the man's name, if he hadn't cast forget.

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to bolt 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to log
You never count your money, when you're sittin' at the fountain
There'll be time for bank runs, when the casting's done.

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to bolt 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to log
You never count your money, when you're sittin' at the fountain
There'll be time for bank runs, when the casting's done.
