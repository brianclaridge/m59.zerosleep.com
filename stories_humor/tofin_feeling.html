<b>"Youve Lost That TOFin' Feeling" by Mathis Beornstanas</b>

to the tune of 
"You've Lost That Loving Feeling" by the Righteous Brothers

You never burn my sides anymore with your fingertips.
And there's no telltale smoke anymore when I kiss your lips.
You're trying hard not to show it, (baby).
But baby, baby I know it...

You've lost that TOFin' feeling,
Burn me standing or burn me kneeling,
You've lost that TOFin' feeling,
'Cause it's gone...gone...gone...wooooooh

Now there's no fiery hate in your eyes when I peek for you.
And we'll have to use gas on the grill when we barbecue.
It makes me just feel like crying, (baby).
'Cause baby, I can't go back to frying.

You've lost that TOFin' feeling,
Burn me standing or burn me kneeling,
You've lost that TOFin' feeling,
'Cause it's gone...gone...gone...wooooooh.

Baby, baby, I soak in kerosene for you.

Just take my zippo and light me like you used to do, yeah.

Set me on  fire...on fire...on fire in a loving daze.

So don't...don't...don't...don't waste this heart ablaze.

Baby (baby), baby (baby),
I beg of you please...please,
I need your TOF (I need your TOF), I need your TOF (I need your TOF),
So bring back the spark (So bring back the spark), Bring back the
spark (so bring back the spark).

Bring back thatTOFin' feeling,
Burn me standing or burn me kneeling,
Bring back thatTOFin' feeling,
'Cause it's gone...gone...gone,
and the flame's not on,
noooo...

Bring back thatTOFin' feeling,
Burn me standing or burn me kneeling,
Bring back thatTOFin' feeling,
'Cause it's gone...gone...gone.
