Chorus: 
-Shalille Superstar, that is what you are
-Casting Minor Heal, no matter how you feel
-Come and truce for me, while I imp my mace 
-We can rely on each other uh huh
-Long as you heal this young sistah uh huh

-Some got Kranaan needs, you got Shalille 
sceems 
-You old high karma mage always in my dreams 
-From MoD'n to kill and healing name your 
theme 
-You'll always be on top, no matter how it 
seems
-Who the hell would confront you? Hmm, what 
would Xiana do 
-All those with pking dreams don't comprehend 
what seance means 
-Holy Touch me please, or maybe cure disease
-Acid Touch immunities, making Qor cower to 
her knees
-Here comes the vile one by one, you rescue 
instead of run
-You got one side to me, if they want to test 
it you'll make them flee 
-Strike with the forces of Xiana's charm 
Casting Hospice, and Reveal, and ID, and 
Major Heal 
-Your gonna teach these trolls, how to live 
in Ukgoth
-While keepin your karma higher than Brax and 
a SoTH 
-Lay low, let your scimi shine like a halo
-And purify your enemies to get that jump 
from the get go

Chorus: 
-Shalille Superstar, that is what you are 
-Casting Minor Heal, no matter how you feel
-Come and truce for me, while I imp my mace 
-We can rely on each other uh huh
-Long as you heal this young sistah uh huh

-Cast Truce, still you don't stop, no
-Your hands are sore, being a Shalille Sage
-Trapped in a cage always fighting these 
qordamn mage
-Most buff seem to ignore, but you engage in 
war
-While newbies are poor, you seem to open 
free for all stores
-So I try and follow you, I can't take this 
darkness no more
-I'm gonna reveal everything, and make all 
angels sing
-I find myself, walking Tos streets
-Find time to stroll to the GY, and cast cure 
disease

-Now every bully has his day, needless to say
-When your away, they make sure to come out 
and play
-You tell them, "Mess around and I drop you 
pk!"
-Wave your hands once you'll have them 
screaming your name
-You venture like Esseldi, and still find 
time for me
-You've got eye's like an angel, make me drop 
to my knees
-You get applaused like Kaloir and his troops 
going to war
-Now come and teach me your ways, near and 
far...

Chorus: 
-Shalille Superstar, that is what you are 
-Casting Minor Heal, no matter how you feel
-Come and truce for me, while I imp my mace 
-We can rely on each other uh huh
-Long as you heal this young sistah uh huh
