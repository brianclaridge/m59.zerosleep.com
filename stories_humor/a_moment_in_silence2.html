They say true friendship must happen over time, that it cannot occur within the few fleeting moments the meeting chances.  It takes time to discover what it is that attracts us to the friendship, even less to uncover what does not.  Unsure of what the other thinks, but unwilling to reveal that which they do.  In the most common of such meetings, conversation is brief, smiles are quick, and impressions are made.  From the first time I heard the voice, I did not suspect that this would differ...<p>

<b>Day 1</b><p>

  I stood unblinking at the words that were casually spoken to me, unsure if I had heard them correctly.
How would I ever be able to obtain a tail feather from a being, not only avarian, a shaman no less.  The young fletcher looked at me with her eyes as if she had heard my thoughts, saying, "The task is in your talent.  The masked one will guide you with no assistance, for he is the falsehood to the truth."<p>

 I nodded and showed the respect one gives to another revealing information for naught in exchange.  It was a quick nod, slightly vexed and beginning to loathe my eagerness for this discipline.<p>

  The jungle would be as good a place to search for more clues to this art, and if I happen upon that avarian rump…<p>
  
<b>Day 2</b><p>

  After retreating for the third time, hope was all but lost to me.  The shaman was not overly difficult to combat, however his kin, two shy of a dozen, were a different matter.  Skilled they are in defending their holy brother, I could not breach the wall about him.  I decided to rest and perhaps counter their defense in some way, I thought it futile, however I enjoy such ventures.<p>

  Their tactics seemed to have changed slightly.  Wondering where the large, tattooed, bow wielding, individual came from, I ran from the small army chasing me through the forest, tripping over the undergrowth, as arrows sunk loudly into the trees about me.<p>

  The small clearing my retreat took me too, was not the haven I mistook it for.  Even as I heard the wet, crunching sound underfoot as I stepped into the nest, I was quite unaware of the fate that loomed above me.  The hiss came first, followed by the knowledge of just how unfortunate my path of flight was.  Trying to run, I stumbled forward flailing my arms to stop, falling.  A sudden flash of pain washed over my face as it met with the rushing ground.  The air grew cold about me, I was sure this was death as an image flashed before my mind's eye of my father and his kind face, perhaps I would find him after all my searching?  What afterlife would be sweeter than one that housed Lum?<p>

  "Are you hurt?"  Came a voice.  I blinked, once, then twice, startled as I thought I heard a voice, not moving as my thoughts of nirvana escaped me. <p>

  "I say are you well sir?"  I turned slowly, rolling onto my back as I looked up to see a bald, dark skinned man staring back at me.   His head, from brow to base, covered with black tattoos, turned slightly as he looked back at me, his eyes narrowing.  <p>

  I nodded slowly, as I looked him over.  He wore a small gold hoop earring in his left ear, which the light reflected off of, the plate armor he wore was tarnished but sturdy.  His gray clothing was slightly dirty and his boots, covered with dust.  My eyes wandered back to his face in time to see his wide grin.<p>

  His hand slowly came toward me as he offered assistance to place me vertical again.  I took his hand and felt his strength as I rose to my feet, noticing that it was oddly cold.  I glanced over my shoulder to see the ghastly image of the half-frozen dragonfly.  I looked back to him.  He smiled and started to blow into his hands as if they were cold.<p>

  "Always disliked that spell, make ones fingers quite uncomfortable." He said as he looked at me still grinning.<p>

  "Ah, but forgive me sir.  My name is Bhaal, and I am at your service."  He bowed low, and resumed his position as he looked my way again.  I nodded and bowed in return, quite thankful for my life.  There was a small moment of silence, broken by him as he spoke with a humorous tease.<p>

  "Well man, have you no voice or name?"<p>

  I slowly shook my head, as I heard the word "voice" come from him.  He looked perplexed for a moment then nodded slightly as he again spoke.<p>

  "If you are in need of rest and company, be informed I have a place for both.  It's not far from here and you are most welcome.  Would you come?"<p>

  The decision of trying to continue my efforts alone here in this jungle or a meal and company with this man was not a hard decision to make.  I nodded and walked toward him, offering my hand in friendship.  He shook it firmly as again his grin widened across his face.  Perhaps an ally would benefit me in my quest…<p>

<b>Day 3</b><p>

  He looked at me and nodded slightly as the sweat from his forehead glistened.  I worked my fingers delicately, casting the incantation while focusing my gaze on the shaman.  The creature seemed to sense what was about to happen, it's wrinkled face grew taught and it's plumage stiffened.  Before I could even turn to Bhaal and confirm the spell had been complete, he was already attacking the now frozen creature.  I raced to his side working my fingers again to hold it in place.  I looked on him as I watched his magic and steel dance, mesmerized by the skill at which it did.  He gave me a quick glance and as though I read his mind, I withdrew my curved blade and began to attack the now feeling shaman.  <p>

  It's wounds were great as I looked upon the blood covering once colorful, tattered feathers.  Such loss for my search of knowledge, I looked at the wounds wondering if this life was mine to take.  Without warning, the ground trembled beneath me, dead branches shook themselves free from trees as I looked to Bhaal who was already racing toward us.  It would seem the shaman was far from finished.  The creature froze again, as I heard from my left, Bhaal repeating the spell I had cast earlier, his scimitar lying in pieces on the ground, the hilt still in his hand.<p>

Then suddenly I realized, just what a fool I had been.  Dropping my scimitar, I raced to the rear of the creature.  I dove forward just as the creature raised it's arms, squawking loudly.  My right hand reached out, finding it's target.  The shaman disappeared with a loud rush of air as I rolled forward, tumbling into a small copse of trees.<p>

"Zounds!  Yet another one flees!"  Bhaal was quite agitated, as he spoke.  I stood up, brushed the undergrowth and earth away from my robes, and walked over to him smiling and holding out a clenched fist.  He looked at me quite puzzled.  I slowly opened my hand revealing the two smashed feathers, the weight of my body had wretched free.  He dropped to his knees throwing his head back laughing as I looked about nervously from the noise.<p>

"Friend, I must applaud you, the thought had never came to mind to simply take the feathers without taking the life.  Good show."<p>

He slowly got up shaking his head as small chuckles escaped from him.  He then stopped and turned to me, looking inquisitive, as he spoke.<p>

"Friend, what is thy name?  I fail to recall that you have told me."<p>

I smiled broadly as I crouched low to the ground, my index finger beginning to write…
