<b>A Guild Like BOO -- TwistedPair</b><br>
(Smithereens, A Girl Like You)<p>

I used to travel in the shadows<br>
And I never found the nerve to try and apply with you<br>
But now I'm a man and I know that there's no time to waste<br>
There's too much to lose<br>
BOO can say anything at all, and you know that they can call<br>
And I'll be right there for BOO<br>
First guild, heartbreak, tough luck, big mistake<br>
What else can I do<p>

CHORUS<p>

I'll say anything they want to hear<br>
I'll see everything through<br>
I'll do anything I have to do<br>
Just to win the love of a guild like BOO, a guild like BOO<br>
People tell and people stare, tell them I don't really care<br>
This is the place I should be<br>
And if they think it's really straange for a guild like BOO<br>
To accept in someone like me<br>
I wanna tell them all to go to hell<br>
That we're doing very well without them you see<br>
That's just the way it is and they will see<br>
I am crazy, I am BOO, and that's the way it should be<p>

CHORUS<p>

Now if I seem a little wild, there's no holding back<br>
I'm trying to get a send to BOO<br>
I won't take anything from anyone<br>
I won't walk and I won't run, I believe in you<br>
Cor Noth, North Barloque, anywhere they are I'll run<br>
Together we'll be<br>
Inside, outside, got my pride<br>
I won't let them broadcast FETT-P<p>
