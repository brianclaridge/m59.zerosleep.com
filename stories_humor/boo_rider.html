<b>BOO Rider</b><br>
(Charlie Danields Band "Uneasy Rider")<p>

I was makin' a trip out to CV,<br>
runnin' along with twenty reds and a frozzie,<br>
icin' on a troll and diggin' the lag-less run.<p>

jes' as I cross into Ukgoth<br>
I heard that troll hit, and my plate was rent<br>
and I knew that it was a long ways to go til Fams.<p>

well the plate was close and I got uptight<br>
'cause there wasn't a mender on tonight<br>
so I jes' limped down the road watchin for trolls.<p>

I went as far as I could and when I stopped the run<br>
it was right in front of this little bar<br>
a kind of a redneck lookin' joint called Familliars.<p>

well I stuffed my teeth up under my hat<br>
and told the mender that I had a flat<br>
and would he be kind enough to give me mends for some saphs<br>
there was one thing I was sure proud to see<br>
there wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me<br>
and he just looked disgusted an' said, "Offer up."<p>

I gave him the plate an' ten saphs or so<br>
and he said he wasn't very busy t'day<br>
and he could have some teeth there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so<p>

he said "now you jes' stay right where yer at" and I didn't bother<br>
tellin'<br>
the durn fool I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go<p>

I jes ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar<br>
when some guy walked in an' said who needs the teeth<br>
for the rent and torn plate that's been mended eight times or so?<p>

well he looked at me and I damn near died<br>
and I decided I better not wait outside<br>
so I leaned on the bar and waited for that Kraanan sound.<p>

jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin<br>
these five big dude come strollin' in<br>
with this one old drunk chick and some fella with green armor<br>
an' I was almost to the door when the biggest one<br>
said "you tip your hat to this lady son"<br>
an' when I did all them teeth fell out from underneath<p>

now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight<br>
in the middle of Tos on a Saturday night<br>
'specially when there was three of them and only one of me<p>

well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick<br>
and I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick<br>
so I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' Boffo right in the knee<p>

he let out a yell that'd curl your hair<br>
but before he could move I grabbed me a chair<br>
and said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man<p>

well you may not know it but this man's a spy<br>
he's an undercover agent for the NWO<br>
and he's been sent down here to infiltrate the B O O<br>
he was still bent over holdin' on to his knee<br>
but everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me<br>
and I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went<p>

I said would you beleive this man has gone as far<br>
as lootin the purple pants off the bodies of BOOs<br>
and he voted for Dragonheart for Justicar<p>

well he's a friend of them thirty hit-point ToFin' wannabe PKers<br>
I betcha he's even got a NwO flag<br>
Tacked up on the wall inside of his hall<p>

he's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys<br>
he may look dumb but that's jus a disguise<br>
he's a mastermind in the ways of espionage<p>

they all started lookin' real suspicious at him<br>
and he jumped up an' said "jes' wait a minute Slim"<br>
you know he's lyin' I've been playin' here all of my life<p>

I'm a faithfull follower of Mathis Beornstans<br>
and I belong to the Blades of the Oracle<br>
and I ain't even got a hall, you can call home and ask my wife<p>

then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed<br>
but I didn't wait around to hear the rest<br>
I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck<p>

and when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks<br>
and they were jes' takin' my plate down off the offer<br>
so I threw the mender a tooth an' slapped that Shal'ille plate on my back<p>

DreamLover woulda sure been proud<br>
of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd<br>
comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot<p>

an' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run<br>
but somehow I couldn't resist the fun<br>
of icin' them jes' once around the fountain<p>

well they're headin' for the gates but I hit 'End'<br>
and spun around and headed out towards the arena<br>
while I was holdin' 'shift' and poundin' on the arrow key<p>

well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin'<br>
like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin'<br>
but I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the Renshai got there<p>

when I hit Outskirts I was really wheelin'<br>
had Icy's flyin' and muties squeelin'<br>
an' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Craggeds<p>

I think I'm gonna re-route my trip<br>
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped<br>
if I went to CV via Jasper!<p>
