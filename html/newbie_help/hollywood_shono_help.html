We were all newbies at one time, some started out better than others.  But like many things, there are a few important things you should know when you are a newbie or have rerolled.<p>

1.  Don't bcast stuff like you're poisoned at xxx location, if there are PKers around they will most likely
come to that area and kill you.<p>

2.  Try to hunt in groups, PKers don't like to pick their shots when there are a bunch of people somewhere.<p>

3.  The beach is a great place for 30-45HP people to train, however a good place for PKers to travel and get a kill or two in.  Never go to a screen alone on the beach if a PKer is on, or stick to the walls so they can't ambush you.<p>

4.  Never carry a lot of cash and God Gifts on you, if you get PKed, you will most likely not get your stuff back, so if you're 30-55HP, avoid using them unless you want to risk them getting looted when you die/get PKed.<p>

5.  NEVER wear Plate/KS while you are under 60HP, touch spells and Bolt/FB do double damage or more with this combo.  Use Scale/GS/Helm when you are starting out, much safer in the long run.<p>

6.  ALWAYS max Weaponcraft first.  Some people say, why do this first?  Well three reasons:  1.  They are a
bitch to do later on since Brawling is a pain in the ass to improve in, and if you do a spell school or two
first before you get to at least Level 4 WC, you're gonna have a tough time.  2.  Dodge and Parry, they do help you avoid more hits, even though before revs you could dodge 3 times as many hits, but nontheless they are still handy to have.  3.  Scim Wielding/Fencing do the most damage(debatable which is better) and if you have spells they are harder to improve.<p>

7.  Try to hunt in areas most people don't go.  For example the Badlands, 99% of the time people usually only go there to check on Faren magic, I've only been killed once there, and that was on 109 a long time  ago, so as you can see not many people fight there.<p>

8.  Use the corners to your advantage, don't fight in the middle of a room if you don't have to.  If you fight in corners only one monster can hit you at a time.<p>

9.  Know how much damage the enemy can do.  If you know a Troll does 3-7 Damage and you see your HP below 15, RUN YOUR ASS OUT of the area.  It's much better to run away than to die and lose all your items and a % or 2(if Red) in most things.<p>

10.  There are a few spells out there that most people don't like to be casted in Public areas.  Winds can piss people off since it can drop your Aim all the way to 1 from 50.  And that means you'd hit a lot of Air.  Heat is another spell that pisses people off(and in some cases killed people, which I have as well :P)  If you see Heat Casted, take your armor off, it won't do any damage to you.  If you have a robe on when heat is Casted it won't affect you.<p>

11.  Don't Bcast that you hit 30HP, it's a good way to get PKed by the 30HP TOFing wusses.<p>

12.  Broadcasts are good to use sometimes, but over 75% of the guild wars are because of Broadcasts where
someone doesn't agree, and you know there will almost NEVER be a time when everyone will agree with you.<p>

13.  Don't be a globe spammer like I am.  If you say the wrong things(I know from experience) you'll get your ass kicked quickly unless you got a lot of people backing you up(Thank god I did, and still do :P).<p>

14.  Don't join a guild right away till you know about all the guilds.  If you don't like guild wars, try to join a neutral guild or make up a new guild.  Or just don't join a guild at all, you'll be safe in towns if a PKer is guilded<p>

15.  If you manage to get a hall, NEVER let people you don't know join you, most likely you can get a spy and then they can try to take over the guild hall.<p>

16.  2 Real good schools to do that can save your life especially if you're a newbie:  Shal'lile for Healing, and Kraanan for resistance spells, one being Touch of Flame favored by most PKers.  Faren isn't too useful, but a fun school to do, but it does have one real good spell:  Resist Cold, good against Qor/Kraanan/WC people which are way too common nowadays.<p>

17.  Pure Fighters are a great way to get cash, you can sell all the regs since you don't need any, except for Orc Teeth usually for mends or Reveals.  Not many people reroll into pure fighters since the mages can use all the special abilities that PF's can't.<p>

18.  Do NOT make any stat 1 Unless you are a pure fighter(then use Intellect/Mysticism for 1), or a Shal mage(1 Stamina) since they can use magic to heal up.  1 Might means you hit for low damage and can't carry much.  1 intellect(good stat to have as 1 before revelations) sucks now unless you had 4 schools mastered already.  1 Stamina means you recover real....real...real..ssssslllllooooowwwww.  1 Agility is only for pure mages.  1 Mysticism is only for Pure fighters.  1 Aim just plain sucks, you hit shit and takes forever to hit stuff. However if you are a mage/fighter you don't need 1 or 2 50's since you would lack points in much needed areas.<p>

19.  If you are truly a newbie(90% of the people are not or pretend they are when they reroll) your safety is default to off.  Turn your safety on,  if you don't know how, ask someone.  There are a few white jerks that kill Orange/Red players simply because they won't get Revs from it.<p>

Well that's about it, a little guide to all you newbies and rerolls out there that can save your ass.<p>
