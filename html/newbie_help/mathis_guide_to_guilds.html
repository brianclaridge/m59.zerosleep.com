<b>Introduction</b><br>
A Meridian guild is a cross between a college fraternity, a street gang, and a family.  Actually, it's more like a scientific experiment in stress, spam, and sarcasm.  You don't have to belong to a guild to have fun
in Meridian, but almost every player joins a guild a some point during their time online.  In or out, guilds are integral to the social and political scenes of any server.<p>

Every guild has a central reason for being.  Some are for building massive characters for server domination.  Some are to be the server police.  Some are just for fun and entertainment.  Most are a mix of these,
and knowing how a guild thinks of itself can be very useful.<p>

<b>Guild Halls</b><br>
In almost every guild, the "hall/no hall" question has to be addressed. There are 15 halls on each server, and usually quite a few more guilds than halls.  Generally speaking, having a hall is a status symbol
among guilds, and the better the hall, the more respect for its owner. In many ways this is silly.  Halls used to be important for the chests that store items, but that's no longer the case with personal vaults for
everyone, including the unguilded.  Halls cost money to maintain, too.  A guild holding Wryn's Keep or the Bookmaker's Hall likely has a daily rent requirement of more than 20K per day.<p>

So why keep a hall at all?  Some guilds choose not to have halls, but most of us like to have a little part of Meridian to call their own. I've run a guild without a hall, and I can't tell you the jubilation we
felt  the day we got one.  Suddenly we didn't have to hold guild meetings in the Tos Adventurer's hall anymore.  We felt we had "arrived" as a guild, even though our new hall was one of the smallest in the game (The Ivory Chapel).  Ten months later we moved to the Bookmaker's Hall (also known as the Casino), and again we were floating on cloud nine.<p>

Logically, the hall shouldn't make that kind of a difference, but it does.  Your hall is a social club for your guild, and while expensive, it's a nice place to go cast spells, do mail, or hold private  conversations.<p>

Like any precious possession, halls are constantly coveted by others.  This tends to make guild members overly suspicious of new members and anyone who asks a lot of questions.  Most hall takeovers are initated
by a traitor in the guild or one of its formal allies, so these fears are not unfounded.  The bottom line is that  people like halls.  Halls are, not surprisingly, one of the largest causes of wars.<p>

<b>Conflict</b><br>
Wars are pretty much caused and fueled by guilds.  A disagreement between individuals is a fight, but to have a war you need to have the numbers and tempers of two or more guilds. A common misconception is that
a war will take place only between two guilds with a problem. This never, ever, ever happens.  The truth is that most of us have friends in a lot of guilds, and we get upset when they die-even if they instigated the matter. Predictably, then, any war is likely to escalate to encompass quite a few guilds and groups.  On 102, for example, many of us have been around so long that every conflict has the potential to turn into a server-wide conflict.  It might not be "right" but it's reality.<p>

<b>Choosing a Guild</b><br>
More than anything, make sure any guild you join shares your goals. Peaceful guilds may be too restrictive; belligerent guilds may be too rough.  Most people find out about guilds through posts and broadcasts, but
do some searching around.  There are many who keep to themselves but still have a lot of fun.

The best way to research guilds is to stand in Fams and read bios. Most people will be happy to tell you a little about their guild, and many will even have an informational gmail to send you.  (<a href="boo_pledge.html">See the sample gmail for Blades of the Oracle from 102</a>)  Make sure you like the people in the guild, you'll probably be spending a lot of time with them.<p>

<b>Questions to ask:</b><br>
1)  What's your guild's "personality" and purpose?<br>
2)  How many members are in your guild?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)  How many are usually online during the hours I usually play?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)  Who are the guild leaders?<br>
3)  Do you own a hall?  (note:  asking which hall may be seen as intrusive-remember that a guild has to be                         semi-paranoid about potential thieves)<br>
4)  Who are your allies/enemies?<br>
5)  What's the rent/dues for being in the guild?<br>
6)  Is there a special uniform?<br>
7)  Do you have an affiliation with either faction?<p>

This is a lot of information to pump out of someone, so be patient-and understand if they don't want to answer every question.  But the more you know about a guild before you enter the more likely you are to
stay once you've made a decision.  Guild leaders respect that.
