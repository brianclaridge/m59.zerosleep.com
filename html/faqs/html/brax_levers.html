Heres a very short and sweet combination. Works when ancient is reset : C,1,2,3,3,4,2,8<br>
Where C is the lever on its own<p>

<b>Prince Bytor (102)</b><p>

First a little ***WARNING***  This will only work if someone has not Screwed around with the Levers since the last time the platform was raised.<p>

How to look at Levers....<p>
on your Left there is a wall with 1 lever on it...<p>
In front of you is a wall with 4 levers on it...<p>
on your Right is a wall with 4 Levers on it...<p>
Start from left to right and label them 1 - 9<p>

Here is the Combination.....<br>
1-2-7-3-4-6-5<p>

Now a few Notes....<br>
How to know if someone has messed up the Levers or not...<p>
The room should start with the Center Pillar up and Brown.. <p>
The 4 Corner Pillars should be Down (Hidden) and Brown.<p>
To check to see the Color of the Pillars that are Down and start the Combination throw switch 1..<p>
this will turn the Center Pillar Green and Rais the other 4 Pillars..<p>
Now the 4 Corner Pillars should be up and all should be Brown, also the Center Pillar should be Green...<p>
If this holds true then continue with the Combination and everything should work just fine....<p>

--More Notes..  If you want to Do it again..  let the room reset the mosters..  It is almost impossible to make the jump with the 50 Skellies that appear when you raise the platform.<p>

**IF Someone has Screwed up the Levers***<br>
You are SOL...  took me a good 2 hours to get this Down..  Now I can figure out how to get it back..  only because I understand the Logic behind the Levers, read the Book and give it a whirl..  Or give me a tell.  I'll try to reset the Pillars if I can.<p>

Heres how it works...<p>

If ya read the descrip on the levers it will tell you either raise/lower or activate, and also tells you which one it does, like corner or center<p>

So You go look and see which poles are up and which are down, and which are green and which are brown<p>

For instance, if all the poles are down, and the center one is brown, you need to flip all the switches up in order for it to raise<p>

If the center one is up and green you just need to hit the activate ones for the corners, and the raise ones<p>

Simple as that :)<p>

But to lower the thing once yer done is still bein figured out<p>
