For fighting Avars of all kinds-people with a good fire or archery can hit the Shaman and Chieftains from a
distance for very good damage-in fact a lot of the Avars stagger from a bow.  And I have found that it is much much easier to kill the Shaman and Chieftains this way and have found it to be the most efficent weapon for them (since chieftains usually drop some arrows) The only downside is that you run out of arrows fast if you aren't killing chieftains-and the bow wears away quickly<p>
