As a Hero of the Knights of the Amber Order, I would like to take a moment to introduce our guild.  The Knights of the Amber Order has been in existence since Meridian began several months ago.  We still have
original characters within our ranks.   As a guild we pride ouselves on being upstanding citizens of Meridian.  We are friends to almost all in Meridian except for the few who look to disrupt society.  We like to take time helping the "newbies" in many ways, ie equipment, cash, lists of items, skills or even adventuring through Meridian to get Nodes. Each one of us is different, but we all share a common goal;  to help others and to improve ourselves while having fun.  If you look at our membership, you will not see thieves or thugs.  We also do not expect that from anyone who wishes to join.   We are a Knightly Order with emphasis on self improvemnet and Knightly virtues. We do not engage in guild conflict or war.  This only leads to unnecessary death and thievery.  Please take some time to talk to some of our members.  Our
guild master is &lt;E&gt;.  Please feel free to talk to him and ask him for his advice on the guild.  Feel free to contact me at any time with questions.  Should you desire membership in our guild, please contact
me, and should I feel that you would make a good candidate I will invite you to join.<p>
