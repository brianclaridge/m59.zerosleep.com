From the north came a tribe of the fiercest most hated warriors the land had ever seen.  Trusting in only each other they traveled the land in search of war.  On rare occasions they would come to town from their hunting grounds on the fields of wrath and best all the local villagers in a tourniment.  Many would like to attribute their skill to bugs or magic, but the renshai know where their skill comes from.  102 has been their greatest challenge for it is a land dominated by law.  To be too good, or to speak your mind sentences your death.  No one tells a renshai what to do or say so naturally problems arose.  If a land is dominated by law it will stagnate, a world dominated by Chaos destroys itself.  But a world of balance can survive.  Without Chaos their is no genious or creativity, and without law their is no structure or order.  The Renshai fight the forces of law in order to acheive balance.  We are but few now....many ppl are too scared to fight with us and have left us.  We are but 7 or 8 fierce fighters that have managed to rack up over 100 kills in 2 weeks.  Many have fought us bravely and died, many were cowards and still died.  We live by our sword, and by our trust in eachother. <p>

           Swords sharp and Gleaming<br>
       Allies few, and enemies streaming<br>
          Fight togeather honor teaming<br>
               and leave our foes<br>
             With entrails steaming.</center><p>
