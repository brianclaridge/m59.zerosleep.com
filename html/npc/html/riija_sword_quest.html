<li> Go to Mad Scientist and say Kohuzotz and he'll ask for you to get a specimen for him (dragonfly queen) Go to the Hive and offer a Meat Pie to a queen to get her to follow you. You must bring it to the Mad Scientists hut and say Kohuzotz again and he'll give a shard.<p>

<b>Nemesis (102)</b><br>
The easiest way to do the queen dragonfly quest (to get the Riija sword) is the following. First, you need some Shal disciple able to truce (and to rescue). Then, go to the hive. Truce. Wait until a queen dragonfly appears. The Shal disciple gives a meat pie to the queen, and rescues to the inn. >From there, it is easy to reach the jungle again with the queen, and from the tower you are only 2 maps away from the mad  scientist' hut. Use truce, just a few are enough, and when near the way out from a map, wait until the queen disappears into the next map. Then go through and truce. The last question is : how the Shal disciple can give the queen to the other ? Easy. You just have to give a meat pie to the queen, and it follows you. Give the queen before going into the hut.<p>

<li> Go to Wulfgang at the Trading Post and say 'inventory' and he'll ask for you to get something like 70 water skins (ignore the 70 wine glasses favor if he gives it to you) You will prolly hafta go to mainland, then back with the water skins or the sort.<p>

<li> Go to Bowmaker's Hut in the Notch in the Jungle, and say 'arrows' to the lady there. She'll give one of two favors:<p>
<font color="#ccccff">A)</font> Kill a Avar Shaman-This one is straight forward, just get the kill blow on an avar shaman somewhere in the jungle. (haven't done this one, so don't know specifics) OR<p>

<font color="#ccccff">B)</font> Trade for the tailfeathers of an Avar Shaman to fletch an arrow. For this, you must go to the orc caves and get a chunk of Nerudite. Then you must go to Xacal (guy who decides wether you can go into jungle) and say 'bribe' then off 1000 shillings, and he'll let you through to jungle. Then go the the Bone Priestess and offer her the Nerudite, and she'll give the tailfeathers to you, which you give to the bow lady to get a riija shard.<p>

<li> Go to Bone Priestess and say 'Riija' and she will say something like "blah blah blah orc boss hedd yadda yadda yadda" Then just go and bring her an orc pitt bosses' head.
