I look around the lands these days, and I shake my head.  So many changes since I was a lad.<p>

When I was a newbie, I didn't have plate mail my  first day.  I had edible mushrooms, sqaushed and stapled to my chest to offer some protection.  And they were nicked and scarred mushrooms.<p>

When I was a newbie, we didn't go around begging for equpment.  We stayed with our maces and edible mushroom armor.  It was honorable.  We died in droves.<p>

When I was a newbie, you could trust people.  When you died, you knew someone was going to save that edible mushroom armor.  Maybe for themselves, ok, but it wasn't going to poof.  That's the kind of people we were--mushroom wearing, dying, thieves.  But there was honor in it.<p>

When I was a newbie, guilds didn't kill each other over petty reasons.  They killed each other for no reason at all.  But we reveled in the honor of senseless death.<p>

When I was a newbie, honor meant something different than it meant today.  It meant chocolate.  This was confusing.  When someone told me I had no honor, despite the fact they could see I was eating a snickers bar, I was very angry.  And when Albion would broadcast "Death for Dishonor" is was generally understood that they wouldn't stand for inferior chocolate.<p>

When I was a newbie, we didn't have lag like this.  We didn't have motion at all.  The game was played in a series of still shots, of which every fourth one was a picture of the Underworld.<p>

When I was a newbie, no one used Alt-F4 to log from battle.  We didn't know about it.  We kept hitting F1 instead, and trying to read furiously for help while trolls dreamed of Mathis-skin coats.<p>

When I was a newbie, the Guardians didn't help us at all.  Well, that one is still true.<p>

When I was a newbie, people didn't talk about Ultima Online this and Ultima Online that.  They talked about Diablo, instead.<p>

When I was a newbie, the future seemed brighter.  Remember, darkness spells didn't make the room darker then.<p>

When I was a newbie, the whole world was in front of us.  Granted, there were only 4 rooms in the whole land, but still.<p>

When I was a newbie, the only spam we heard from me was ### Mathis Beornstanas was just killed by a giant rat, who wasn't even really giving it his full attention.<p>

When I was a newbie, we didn't need a language filter.  Then again, none of us talked to Chad from 3do Customer Service, either.<p>

When I was a newbie, didn't reroll every 10 minutes and max characters in a week.  We struggled and died and generally did stupid things.  We were guild-spamming, no-reason killing, foul-mouthed swearing, Diablo-whining, F1-pressing, honor-munching, edible-mushroom-armor-wearing, theiving, cynical bastards in well lit "darkened" rooms.  Ah, those were the good old days.
