<i>A long time ago, waaay before the last update...</i><p>

On the desert planet Fig-Newteen, a young baker named Mathis Pastryeater must come to terms with his
past. He flees to the home of hermit Bon Cannoli after his Nabisco Outlet store is burned to the ground by
the Empire's forces, led by the evil Attaturk.<p>

Mathis asks Bon about his father...<p>

Mathis: You mean to tell me that YOU are Edi Bel Cannoli? But Edi Bel is a master of the old ways...Edi
Bel is a Keebler Elf!<p>

Bon: I haven't gone by that name in some time...not since the Toll House Cookie Wars.<p>

Mathis: I know that was a bad time...<p>

Bon: You cannot imagine...our way of life crumbling around us...falling to pieces. But when the chips were
down, we pulled together.<p>

Mathis: Did my father fight with you?<p>

Bon: Yes. Your father was one of the sharpest dessert chefs I ever trained. He could make six batches of cookies before anyone else was even out of that tree we lived in.<p>

Mathis: What happened to my father?<p>

Bon: Attaturk killed him.<p>

Mathis: Attaturk was a Keebler Elf, too?<p>

Bon: Yes, he was also a bright prodigy<p>

Mathis: What happened to him?<p>

Bon: He was seduced by the Dark Side of the Oreo.<p>

Mathis: The Oreo?<p>

Bon: The Oreo is the most powerful element in the universe, much like The Force, but different enough to circumvent international copyright laws. The light fluffy inside is where our strength comes from...it is the source of good. The dark cookie outside is seductive and the source of evil...Attaturk ate it,
and now he cannot return to the "stuff". You must never eat the Dark Side of the Oreo.<p>

Mathis: I swear it, Edi Bel!<p>

<i>much, much later, in the famous duel scene, after Mathis kisses the Princess Mercy with will later turn out to have been an incestous mistake...Attaturk and Mathis duel atop a bridge in the Cotton Candy City.</i><p>

Mathis: Attaturk, this is horrible!<p>

Attaturk: This rip-off of Star Wars? I agree! As if it hasn't been done a hundred times by now...
Mathis: No! Worse than that! I'm afraid of heights!<p>

Attaturk: &lt;evilly&gt; Don't look down!<p>

Mathis: &lt;looks down&gt; Nooooo!<p>

Attaturk: &lt;furnishes an oreo&gt; Eat the dark side, Mathis, it will become a part of you as it has become a part of me...I am the dark cookie and it is me...eat me, Mathis.<p>

Mathis: &lt;to the audience&gt; Oh gimme a break. &lt;returns to the fight&gt; I will never eat the cookie outside!<p>

Attaturk: &lt;grabs a glass of milk&gt; Not even if I dunk it like this? Mmmmmm.<p>

Mathis: &lt;fighting himself&gt; No! I will not!<p>

Attaturk: Edi Bel never told you about your father...<p>

Mathis: He told me you killed him!<p>

Attaturk: No, Mathis, I am your father!<p>

Mathis: Noooooooooooo.<p>

Attaturk: It's true! And Mercy is your sister, and Mirage your mother-in-law, and Thalice your nephew, even though SunTzus is his brother, but unrelated to you--I still can't figure that one out--and Guildenstern is your half-brother or maybe step-brother. In any case, that kiss between you and Mercy was just gross. Don't do that again. She and Hans Bacon are destined for each other.<p>

Mathis: Why do you say they are destined for each other?<p>

Attaturk: Dunno, just a feeling I get. When he looks at her I can see joy in his eyes.<p>

Mathis: Eww. Don't get all mushy on me, pops. Er...where were we?<p>

Attaturk: &lt;scrolls up&gt; OK...Fig-Newteen...horrible parody...got milk...aha! Eat the cookie, and join me!<p>

Mathis: Never! But...I've been thinking. Perhaps we can resolve this some other way...some compromise.<p>

Attaturk: &lt;shrugs&gt; Sure...this thing is pretty long already, and I don't know how to end it.<p>

Mathis: The answer is in this bag.<p>

Attaturk: &lt;peers inside&gt; Cookies 'n' Cream Ice Cream! yaaaaay!<p>

<i>And thus everyone was happy. Except Mathis, who still couldn't figure out the SunTzu thing.</i>
