You say, "***Lightning crashes, and as you look up at the clock tower, you see Julian on top of it.***"<br>
Julian loses his footing and hits the ground with a *THUMP*<br>
Julian shakily gets to his feet and brushes himself off<br>
You say, "I wrote this next song while I was laying in a puddle of my own vomit."<br>
Julian tunes his guitar and prepares to play a song.<br>
Julian sings, "Spudmen from mars......they're really mean....they like to shoot people......the end..<br>
Julian sings, "Yeah, the spudmen came to my house....the beat me with a stick...then they...they...."<br>
Julian screams, "THEY ZAPPED ME WITH A SPUD RAY!!!!"<br>
Julian plays a killer solo on his guitar and then resumes his song.<br>
Julian sings, "Watch out, for the spudmen will come back soon! Watch out! They're mean!!"<br>
Julian begins to dance around on stage<br>
Julian goes into a frenzy and smashes his guitar on the ground<br>
Julian bows and says, "Thank you, thank you." <br>
