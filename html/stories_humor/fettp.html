It was a dark and stormy night.  In the real world, it was Christmas Day, 1996, but not in Meridian.  There's never been any snow in Meridian, or any rain.  The worst we get is the "heat" spell, but even that isn't too bad, because the creators left out an obvious Riija spell, "humidity".  Despite this lack of weather, the gods invented pants.<p>

Back then, pants made little sense to many of the Blades of the Oracle (BOO).  First, we were clad in perfectly good tights that never wore down.  Second, pants cost money and it seemed like a waste.  Third, they only came in two colors.  Red for men, blue for women.  As far as we were concerned, if you needed color-coding to tell men from women, you had bigger problems than fashion.<p>

Let's get back to this specific date in 102 history.  Because of the RL holiday, people were in a giving mood.  By people, I mean "Horizon and Red Dog".  Everyone else was sticking to the traditional, "What the fuck are YOU looking at" attitude that we've perfected on the server.  As for BOO, we were in our infancy.  Our spam was rarely more than one line long.  We had 8 members played by 7 people.<p>

Also, we had no guild hall.  This was occasionally a topic of conversation.  Sometimes we'd go almost twenty seconds at a time before someone suggested we take a hall, merge with someone who had a hall, go spray paint graffiti on a hall, or some such activity.  It was very similar to the "Are we there yet?" chants that drive parents to drink things named "Fuzzy Navels".  We didn't have many plans for hall takeovers, because we couldn't agree on how many halls there actually were.  We thought maybe four.  But since we knew that the members of Unity (Albion, Guardians of the Flame, and Shadow Knights) could all kick our butts, we looked toward Army of Light.  AOL could kick our butts, too, but we fantasized about being able to beat them.  We fantasized about a great many things in those days; we were lonely and didn't believe the rumors about blindness.<p>

As stated earlier, Horizon and Red Dog were in a giving mood.  They were also, coincidently, AOL's ranking members.  And, as if that weren't enough, they were giving out pants.<p>

Each of them had a pile of pants.  Men's pants.  Women's pants.  It was sickening.  And they were broadcasting about it.  Mercy and I already had a formal no-pants policy, but for the rest of the guild it had been informal.  This plethora of pro-pants propaganda pushed them over the proverbial precipice.  Horizon accosted Mercy in an effort to get her into pants (and presumably then get them off her), and she complained in guild sends.  Lithium leered, "We'll probably take the hall and the shirts off their backs.  Let them keep their pants."<p>

And so we did.  For a while.  But finally I sauntered into Tos, fresh from an Ukgoth-Sentinel-Ancient loop.  Miraculously, I hadn't died, but apparently I'd lost a few key brain cells.  When I came into town, Horizon saw me and immediately offered.  Forgetting the past 3 hours of conversation, I looked at the offer.  Pants.  Of course.  After a moment's hesitation, I decided that the only way to free myself from further harassment was to accept the offer.  As I walked away from him, and toward Fams, I sent a guild send of explanation, "Horizon offered and I accepted.  My attitude is fuck 'em, take the pants."<p>

My dear sister Mercy picked up on the line and transformed it.  "Fuck 'Em!  Take The Pants!" she sent.  Moments later it became FETTP, the BOO rallying cry.  Occasionally, you'll see the updated version, FETTPP, which adds Purple, the only acceptable BOO pant color if you're not naked.  And legend has it that if you ask old man Horizon you will find he has both FETTP and FETTPP in his profanity filter to this day.  =)<p>

BOO members on that day:   reaper, Mercy, Lithium, Frostbite, Frost, Elvis Bacon, Aries, Mathis Beornstanas, Aarzak
