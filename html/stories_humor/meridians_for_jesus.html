        (press F1 for help).<br>

        Welcome to the game, Greenwich.<br>

        Vesper appeals: Please answer<br>

        </font><font size="1" face="MS Sans Serif">You tell

        Vesper, &quot;Yes?&quot;<br>

        Vesper tells you, &quot;I have been talking on the phoen

        with my aunt fo about 1 hour, and have decided to leave

        meridian59.......it is pulling me towards the devil and

        away frm Jesus..and I wish to again follow the path of

        JESUS CHRIST...hwo do I delete my account? THIS IS HARD

        FOR ME..&quot;<br>

        Vesper tells you, &quot;I don't wanan be on here that

        much longer, or I will be again sucked back into the

        depths of this game&quot;<br>

        Vesper tells you, &quot;Where do I go to delete my

        account?&quot;<br>

        You tell Vesper, &quot;I'm not Customer Service. Please

        call the Customer Service phone number. Sorry you feel

        that way... I guess I don't see how being with friends in

        a virtual community can be against an Earth religion, but

        I won't interfere.&quot;<br>

        Vesper tells you, &quot;wel....I didn't understand

        either&quot;<br>

        Vesper tells you, &quot;Then I realised....being able to

        cast spells, and stuff, is against god&quot;<br>

        Vesper tells you, &quot;I have been playing stuff like

        this fo years, and I hate to leave&quot;<br>

        Vesper broadcasts, &quot;How do I delte my account? I

        have decided to leave muds, and online games FOREVER..I

        have been tugged away frm the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and

        pulled towards the devil..Please heed my call, and do not

        call me crazy....HAIL JESUS CHRIST, AND MY NEW LIFE OF

        CHRISTIANITY!!&quot;<br>

        Vesper broadcasts, &quot;How do I delete my
