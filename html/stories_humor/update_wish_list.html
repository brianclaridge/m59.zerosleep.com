Dear Chad,<p>

I know you're not the CEO of 3do, but you seem to be the one with all the power.  The holiday season has passed, but I'd like to request a few changes in the next update.  Frankly, the gods' gifts are getting old, and I'd like something that makes me LESS likely to be killed and frustrated.  Here's a short list of things I'd love to find in my stocking:<p>

<ol>
<li> An ATM in the Casino in North Barloque, even if it charges 100 shils per withdrawal.<p>
<li> A debit card I can use for any merchant in Meridian.  Carrying around all that cash is tedious and risky.<p>
<li> Meat pie delivery service, a la Domino's.<p>
<li> System saves that start and finish in the same lifetime.<p>
<li> Snow rats and stone trolls that aren't just a grayscale version of the regular rats and trolls.<p>
<li> A KFC franchise on the island that buys avar corpses.<p>
<li> An inn that really rents rooms for those online relationships that get lusty.<p>
<li> A vendor hawking hot dogs in the Arena.<p>
<li> The bottoms to go with those bikini tops.<p>
<li> Some equipment for the baseball field in Marion.<p>
<li> A soup stand that doesn't serve reds at all.  "No soup for you!" the NPC would yell.<p>
<li> An online manual, so we can show wayward Guides and Guardians what the real rules are when they OOG us for saying "bitch" and "bastard".<p>
<li> System messages in a nice "sea foam" color.<p>
<li> A "New York/New Jersey" line halfway through the tunnel to the island.<p>
<li> A mailguild command.  Pleeeeeeeease.<p>
<li> A mailpeoplewhoannoyme command.  Also would be useful.<p>
<li> Put the OOG people in a stockade instead, with the same rules that offenders can't talk, but can still be talked to.<p>
<li> Turn the fountains green for St. Patrick's Day.<p>
<li> Turn the fountains red for Qor Day.<p>
<li> Turn the fountains milk white for the "Oreo Festival".<p>
<li> Little openings in the guild hall doors you can look through to see who's knocking.<p>
<li> Showers.  A lot of us are walking around with "helm hair".<p>
<li> A hammer of unlimited mana.<p>
<li> The board game Clue.  Chess is getting really old.<p>
<li> Reagent vending machines in out-of-the-way fighting spots.<p>
<li> Covers for guild hall switches that make them look more like lava lamps.<p>
<li> Change lupoggs to look like cute and fuzzy bunnies.<p>
<li> A library where you could look up Adv. Hall globe posts from any time since the server's beginning.<p>
<li> Create a third token faction headed by "Doogie"<p>
<li> Let the Princess and Duke sit down.<p>
<li> Make it so that Drechx falls over if you cast "winds".<p>
<li> Add a feature that allows you to see who a reroll used to be. Add another button that lets you look down deep into their soul.<p>
<li> A lag cube that doesn't just show you what your lag is now, but also shows how much worse it'll get when you attack that troll.<p>
<li> Random NPC streakers.<p>
<li> Rain.  White t-shirts for the women.  I think you see where I'm going with this one.<p>
<li> A Bennigan's franchise, with broken swords, shields, and old posts up on the walls.  All the waiters and waitresses can blame long waits on lag.<p>
<li> Deodorant.  I have noticed that sometimes the monsters run from us now, and I think I know why.<p>
<li> Fake IDs, so I can claim my character is 2 years old (which would explain a lot of my silly questions and most of my deaths).<p>
<li> Yoohoo chocolate drink.  Not so much for the taste, but for the 5 vitamins and 7 minerals.<p>
<li> "The Club" for hall switches.<p>
<li> Tape, so that we can write "TOF me" on a Royal Ballot and slap it on someone's back.<p>
<li> And island with chicken warriors, insanely large gnats, and reptiles that spend half their time on the forest canopy.  Nah, you're right. Too silly.<p>
<li> A "Dunk the Aginor" booth, where you can throw a mushie, hit a target, and dunk Aginor in the water.  Make the dunks last 8-10 hours each.<p>
<li> Change the "appeal" command to "pray" because it'd take a miracle to get a response.<p>
<li> Sell "hot tamale" candies in the UW.<p>
<li> Have an NPC in the UW asking, "Hot enough for ya?"<p>
<li> Have statues in the UW of frequent diers.<p>
<li> Create a node that can only be reached by purchasing a motorcycle and jumping the Snake River Canyon.<p>
<li> Create a node that can only be accessed by blackmailing your faction leader.<p>
<li> A new monster than only pursues people who talk in all caps.
</ol><p>

Thanks for the attention, Chad.  And if you see Trip, please tell him I'm still waiting for my Revelations CD.
