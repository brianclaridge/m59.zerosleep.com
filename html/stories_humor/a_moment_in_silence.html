<p>The search for knowledge has on numerous occasions placed my existence in peril.  From the local taverns to the savage frontiers of this land, I have yet to uncover a useful piece of knowledge without first overcoming an obstacle of significance.  Most of these barriers are difficult to overcome, however with patience and a small amount of fortune they can be solved.  Then there are those that frustrate one to utter hopelessness…

<p>I stepped out onto the windy, rocky clearing as I slowly gazed about the area, the walls looming around me as if they scowled upon my presence.  The odor was thick and unsavory, not much unlike that of a rotting corpse spending days under the sun.  My hand covered my nose, instinctively, as it assaulted my sense of smell.  Even the name, Ukgoth, rolls off the tongue with a malevolent taste.  The location I sought was still some distance away and the day was soon to end.  Examining my equipment and provisions, I walked cautiously forward from the ledge, assuring myself the personification I imaged the cliffs to wield was my own fantasy.

<p>The silvery moon was high in the night sky when I happened upon the area, it's textured surface illuminated by the moon.  The runes were there just as I was informed they would be.  My hand reached out, touching them, slowly moving across the grooves made by sorcery long ago.  The aura of enchantment I felt as I made contact with the stone left my hairs raised and my body shivering slightly.  I quickly produced my journal and charcoal, turning to a blank page, and made a rubbing of the ancient letters.  Shaking my head slightly as I finished, I could not help to touch them again, such art places me in dumbfounded awe.  I looked to the sky and noticed that midnight had arrived and I proceeded.  I pulled the satchel from my shoulder, searching inside for the artifact I had placed within it the day before. I smiled widely as the moon's beams of light seemed to aid me all the more.

<p>I paused as I pulled the item free from my satchel, trying to remember the story told to me by a friend, in my youth, regarding the ritual I was about to perform.  He told me to hold the rod aloft as high as I could reach, then too simply touch the runes, all the while thinking of vile goddess known as Qor.  If only old D'Franco could be here now, so I could see his face as he saw the small lad he used to scare with his stories of this place, stand here triumphantly on the threshold of discovery.  I laughed silently as the words I am sure he would speak all to quickly, screaming himself hoarse, came to mind, "Put that down and get away from there lad, or you will feel the back of my hand, tempered by Kraanan himself!"  It was wise of Lum to place me with him while he was absent.  I could not ask for a better friend, but of course I would never reveal that to him.

<p>I shook my head slightly, chasing thoughts of the past away, as I concentrated on the task before me.  I reached to the stars holding the scepter as my other hand, all to willingly, rest on the runes, my thoughts focused on Qor.  The wind howled and echoed continuously as it had done from my first moments here.  I blinked, composed myself, and attempted the ceremony again.  The wind again was my only answer.  Looking at the scepter, I wondered if the man selling it to me was having a good laugh at my expense.  I continued for some time, shaking the rod several times in-between each act, well into the early morning before abandoning the quest for sleep.  Could D'Franco's ghost stories be just that, smoke and mirrors for the entertainment of a small boy?

<p>Several days slipped by as I barely slept and scarcely ate as my attention was always on the quest.  The result always the same, with me listening to the wind as I stood still resembling a marble likeness.  In truth I thought it to be a lost cause, however I would not give in to my own faltering patience.  After all, elderberries and herbs make a nutritional gruel, even though it's taste can be compared to that of old, ink-stained parchment.  During this time, my frustration was well over its peak.  Each night I would kick or otherwise injure myself on the textured wall as I left it for the safety of my camp, which was in disarray beyond reason.  My dreams, teasing me of success then ultimately failure at the last moment, disturbed what little sleep I could achieve.

<p>I would have gone quite insane and I must say I could have accepted that, had it not been for the small lithe figure of a dark skinned lass that I came upon at the site all to familiar to me.  Had my mind not been so focused on the selfishness of my goal, I would have been quite embarrassed at my disheveled appearance.  I made my presence known and simply looked at her.  She smiled back and spoke politely, "Good day sir, my intention is not to disturb you.  Just merely to view the runes on the cliff-face, as I often do when I travel through this pass.  I assume you are here for no less?"

<p>I nodded with satisfaction, knowing she was here to look on the runes and nothing more, however I was more focused on the task I came to complete, than to make idle conversation with this young woman.  I once again lifter the scepter up high, touched the runes while my mind drifted to thoughts of Qor.  I only heard the wind in my ears, howling madly as it raced up and down the cliff passages.  I repeated it the process several times until I heard a sound of jest behind me.  Now mind, you my patience was all but lost and my tolerance for amusement, on my behalf, was absent as well.  I turned quickly, my lips pursed with anger, my eyes narrowing, as I looked upon the lass, clad in leather and scarcely 18 winters old.  She only smiled back sweetly, as if her innocence were indeed a genuine thing, as she spoke.

<p>"Sir you must speak the words if you wish to invoke the runes and raise the wall."

<p>I stayed as I was as the wind continued its assault, unblinking at her words, my mouth opened in disbelief.  She looked back to me for a few silent moments, her smile, sincere if not childlike as she stood from her place of rest and motioned for me to hand over the rod I held in my limp hand.  I stood still as the shock of my ignorance slowly began to wear off.  She slowly slipped the rod from my possession and walked to the runes, hold it high in he air as her delicate hand touched the runes, saying "Qor, the vile, a believer wishes entrance and her name is PaganAngel."  Neither my eyes or mouth could open wider as I heard a faint grating of stone somewhere within depths of the sheer wall of stone.

<p>A door sized slab of granite, holding the runes on its face, slowly, silently slipped downward into the earth of this stony place.  She stepped into the opening that revealed a tunnel carved from the stone.  She looked back to me and motioned for me to follow.  My feet would not move nor the stubborn expression of dumbfounded shock from my face.  She reached out and grabbed my hand softly as she pulled me inside.  She looked me over as if concerned, then she spoke holding my hand tightly. "How much time have you spent at this place sir?"  I shook my head slowly from side to side, as I watched the granite wall silently slide back into place.  Tears began to descend from my bloodshot eyes as I saw our shadows disappear from the wall, being consumed by the darkness.  My head fell into my hands.<p>
