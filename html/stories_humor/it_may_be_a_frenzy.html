<b>"It may be Frenzy" -- TwistedPair</b><br>
(You May Be Right -- Billy Joel)<p>

Friday night I crashed your party<br>
Saturday I said I'm sorry<br>
Sunday came and trashed my plate again<br>
I was only having fun<br>
Was hurting everyone<br>
And we all enjoyed the frenzy for a change<p>

I've been stranded in the Jasper zone<br>
I walked through Tos streets alone<br>
Even wore my knight's sheild in the frenzy<br>
And you told me not to die<br>
so I made it home alive<br>
So you said that only proves that I'm insane<p>

It may be night<br>
It may be frenzy<br>
But it just may be an easy kill you're looking for<br>
Turn out the light<br>
Don't try to slay me<br>
You may be wrong for all I know<br>
But you may be right<p>

Remember how I found you there<br>
Alone in Forgotten Lover's Tryst<br>
I told you dirty jokes until you ToF'd<br>
You were lonely for a kill<br>
I said BOO'll appreciate your good-will<br>
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for awhile<p>

Now think of all the years you tried to<br>
Find a frenzy to satisfy you<br>
I might be as crazy as you say<br>
If I'm crazy then it's true<br>
That it's all because of you<br>
And you wouldn't want me any other way<p>

It may be night<br>
It may be frenzy<br>
But it just may be an easy kill you're looking for<br>
It's too late to fight<br>
It's too late to frenzy<br>
You may be wrong for all I know<br>
But you may be right<p>

It may be night<br>
It may be frenzy<br>
But it just may be an easy kill you're looking for<br>
Turn out the light<br>
Don't try to slay me<br>
You may be wrong for all I know<br>
But you may be right<br>
You may be wrong but you may be right<br>
You may be wrong but you may be right<p>
