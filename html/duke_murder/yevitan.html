Yevitan tells you, "Somone said that the Princess and Jonas have been becoming quite good friends lately.  Maybe she hired him to kill the Duke?  He isalways looking to prove his fighting ability."<p>

Yevitan says, "Well you know Quintor killed poor Qesino."<p>

Yevitan says, "They say ole Duke Kalior was a pale green color when they found him, sounds like poison to me."<p>

Yevitan says, "Oh, I doubt that the person that killed the Duke did the deed alone.  I am sure anyone, even the Princess, could have hired some shady character to murder in cold blood."<p>
