Bei Naq tells you, "Well, I'm sure I don't know anything about that.  I was visiting my mother; she's not well you know.  But if you think about it, it seems like the necromancers have been awfully quiet lately, maybe too quiet."<p>

Bei Naq says, "I've heard that Jonas never cleans his sword in public like he sometimes did before the Duke's murder.  What is he trying to hide?"<p>

Bei Naq says, "Ever since the little 'incident' Yevitan has had it in for Duke Kalior, you know he fancies himself the next King."<p>
