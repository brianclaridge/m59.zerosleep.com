Priestess Qerti'nya says, "Akardius follows Riija? Bah! Kalior was the true Duke. He followed the mighty Kraanan!"<p>

Priestess Qerti'nya says, "There is more to Duke Akardius then meets the eye;  ever wonder where he's been all these years?  The Island, studying at the Temple of Riija, that's where!  I tell you, anyone who has spent that much time with the God of Trickery isn't to be trusted."<p>

Priestess Qerti'nya says, "You know Priestess Tenuv'vyal has always been a little on the strange side, but lately she has just been slipping further and further away, I wonder why."<p>
