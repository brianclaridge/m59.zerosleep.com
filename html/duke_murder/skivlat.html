Skivlat says, "It is unfortunate, but I'm sure that the driving force behind the Duke's unfortunate end is related to taxes.  Perhaps someone was tired of paying the high taxes, or perhaps another party wanted the
tax money for themselves?"<p>

Skivlat says, "Hey, doesn't Jonas give very generously to the Temple of Kraanan the Fist?  I wonder if his personal wealth is in trouble."<p>
