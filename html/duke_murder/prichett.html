Pritchett says, "The Duke was a scoundrel, but I am not sure that his grizzly death was fitting, even for one such as he."<p>

Prichett says, "Madelia told me that she went on a picnic with Akardius and that afterward he got very upset and ran off, crying, "Oh how could I have done this to poor Princess Kateriina?"   Could they be in love?  The Old Duke certainly wouldn't have approved of that!"<p>

Prichett says, "I have it from a very authoritative source that Kalior was beaten to death, but I don't believe it for a second.  I'm certain Maleval did it and a beating just isn't his style."<p>

Prichett says, "I've heard people say that Roq must have killed the Duke, just because he's an assassin.  I think that's silly.  And anyway, Roq couldn't have done it because I bought a dagger from him around the time of the murder.  That is, a friend told me he bought one.  A small one."<p>

Prichett says, "Joguer had much correspondence with Roq, who do you think scrounged up a lot of those strange chemicals for his experiments."<p>
