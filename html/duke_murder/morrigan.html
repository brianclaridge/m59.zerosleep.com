Morrigan tells you, "I always had the feeling that Maleval was the real power behind the throne.  Perhaps he grew tired of his puppet."<p>

Morrigan tells you, "I've heard that one of the Duke's guards saw someone who looked exactly like the Duke walking out of the castle after the Duke had died.  He ran up to investigate, but whoever it was just disappeared, leaving only a puddle of slimy goo."<p>

Morrigan tells you, "What other motive can there be but money?  With the shocking news of the death of the Duke, those in power could raid his holdings and gain some money.  Look at the faction troops roaming the lands.  They aren't cheap, you know."<p>

Morrigan tells you, "Well, Jonas is a master of a variety of weapons, as he often reminds us.  I'm sure he's a master of whatever type of weapon was used in the murder of the Duke."<p>

Morrigan tells you, "Why do you think Roq hides out in the sewers?  Rumor has it that he killed Queen Katria all those years ago, and he's still in hiding.  Of course, my aunt used to say it was Kalior himself who put him up to it, so perhaps justice has been served."<p>

Morrigan tells you, "The murder of the Duke is a tragedy.  I think that no one is really above suspicion, even the fair Princess.  But, what kind of weapon would she use?"<p>

Morrigan says, "I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but a friend of mine works as a guard for the Duke and he says that there is a big cover up going on.  Seems the Duke wasn't murdered at all!  He killed himself trying to take off an Amulet of the Three!"<p>

Morrigan says, "A friend says she heard the Duke scream exactly four times.  Does that mean he was stabbed multiply?"<p>

Morrigan tells you, "Maleval certainly seems to like young Akardius.  He seems almost protective.  I suppose it's only natural after what happened to Kalior."<p>
