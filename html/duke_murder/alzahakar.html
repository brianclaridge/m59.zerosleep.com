Alzahakar tells you, "I saw a strange figure in the forest near Tos the night of the Duke's death.  It was a small person, perhaps about the size of a young girl."<p>

Alzahakar says, "I find that I am torn when placing my vote. Akardius is new, yet quite capable."<p>

Alkhazar says, "Isn't it strange that the Duke was murdered so violently, but no one saw or heard anything?  Perhaps there was some strange magic at work that night."<p>

Alkhazar says, "There have been whispers about the dark wizard Maleval...  I think people are just frightened of him because he's so mysterious."<p>

Alkhazar says, "I heard someone say that they stopped by the Faren Temple on the night of the murder and Tenuv'vyal wasn't there."<p>
