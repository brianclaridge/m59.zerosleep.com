Parrin Aragone says, "You know I wouldn't be surprised if it was a crime of passion and Madelia was the center with Duke Kalior the victim."<p>

Parrin Aragone sings, "Poison, poison, icky sticky poison.  Who would have thought the dukie would fall to nasty, smelly poison."<p>

Parrin Aragone tells you, "Well, there have been a lot of rumors flying around about Maleval or the Princess or you name it. Some fool probably even suspects me. But I wouldn't be surprised if the Duke had some secret lover; looks like a crime of passion to me."<p>
