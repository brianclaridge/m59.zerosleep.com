Allows the casters to detect a player's location for a limited time. The hunted player's name must be spoken during the initial trance. When the enchantment fires, for the duration of the spell the hunters will receive periodic notification of the hunted player's whereabaouts. Requires all of the claws from one kriipa paw, and the casters' mystical energies must be focused through a prism.<p>

<b>Belisarius (101)</b>
The solution to the problem with the spell is to say the persons name before you cast, then cast, then use the drop down box to re-say the name.<p>

<b>Melody (102)</b><br>
As with shatterlock, you'll  need to have a prism lying on ground in front of you. However, you'll also need a Sword of the Hunt EQUIPPED (carrying one isn't enough) to cast this spell.<p>

Now if you just cast the spell, you'll get this after you focused a while:<br>
<i>You try to find a trail, but since you aren't looking for anyone in particular, you find nothing.</i><p>

and no imps possible there cause spell not really casted = P<p>

Reason: you must "say" someone's name right after you started your focus.Then , as with shatterlock, you get the qor "animate" sound and the "hunt" icon appears amongst your PE spells location.<p>

Problem : let's say I wanna "hunt" Konev Deathbringer or General Sun Tzu..I'll probably loose my focus before i can type it correctly  &lt;eg&gt;... glad there are some people called "Conan"  out there LOL<p>
