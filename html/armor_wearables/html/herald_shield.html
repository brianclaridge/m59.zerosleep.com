		<li> Herald Shield Quest<p>
<b>1)</b> You go to either Tova, Pietro, or Meidei, not including D'Franco or Paddock and say "hello".  Either one of them will tell you which smithy (Quintor, Colhorr) is insterested in mining expedition. (I've not gotten any favor from D'Franco or Paddock.)<p>

<b>2)</b> Go to the appropriate blacksmith and say to them "Mining  Expedition".<p>

<b>3)</b> The blacksmith will say " Ya da, ya da, ya da...good quality ore....etc"<p>

<b>4)</b> You then offer him a chunk of ore and he will make you a herald shield. He will only do one per expedition.....you can't give him 3 ore chunks and expect to get 3 shields. Nerudite ore doesn't work.<p>

<b>Monthar Kragan (106)</b><br>
The guild leader is only needed to design the shield. After that anyone in the guild can got to one of the
three mainland blacksmiths and say mining expedition. If that smith is in the mood you will get the message
about getting him some ore. Offer a chunk to him and you will have your shield. The bartenders are not even
needed to get this favor. However take the ore with you when you try to get one as you will not have time to obtain any before you lose the favor. I have proved this several times over. I obtained one 4 times which I gave to members of my guild. I also lost the favor 3 times because I could not get ore from my vault to Quintor in time. <p>

<b>To get Spell school insignia on herald shield:</b><br>
You say, "May I wear the insignia of the Goddess/God on my shield?"<p>
After you make your  comment to her she will say, "That I noticed you don't have an crest on your  shield, and she could put the Goddess/God insignia  on as if you pay her a tithe.  You say "tithe" and then she gives you the mission. Complete the mission and go back to her.
